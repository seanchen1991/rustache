Rustache [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rustache/rustache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rustache/rustache)
====

[Rustache](https://rustache.github.io) is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation of the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) spec.

## Documentation

The different Mustache tags are documented at the [mustache(5)](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) man page.

The project's docs page is located [here](https://rustache.github.io/doc/rustache/).

## Install

Install it through [Cargo](https://crates.io/):

```toml
[dependencies.rustache]
git = "https://github.com/rustache/rustache"
```

Then link it within your crate like so:

```rust
extern crate rustache;
```

## API Methods

The main forward interface that users will interact with when using Rustache are the `rustache::render_file` method and the `rustache::render_text` methods like so:

```rust
// Renders the given template file
rustache::render_file("path/to/template.html", data)

// Renders the given template string
rustache::render_text("{{ name }}", data)
```

## Examples

Here's an example of how to pass in data to the `render_text` method using the `HashBuilder`:

```rust
let data = HashBuilder::new()
    .insert_string("name", "Bob");

rustache::render_text("{{ name }}", data);
```

Here's an example of how to pass in data in the form of a JSON `enum` to a `render` method:

```rust
let data = json::from_str(r#"{"name": "Bob"}"#);

rustache::render_text("{{ name }}", data);
```

## Testing

Simply clone and run:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] 106 of 106 Mustache spec tests passing. Current(74)

- [ ] Rewrite the parser and compiler to handle all mustache cases

- [ ] Rebuild API surface to have only the Render trait, `render_text` and `render_file`

	 - [ ] impl Render for HashBuilder, Json, etc.

- [ ] Thread errors through the parser and compiler by having something like:

	 - [ ] type RustacheResult<T> = Result<T, RustacheError>;

	 - [ ] pub enum RustacheError {
	      ParseErrorType(ParseError)
	   }

	 - [ ] pub enum ParseError { }
